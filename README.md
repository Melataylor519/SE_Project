Computation:

Largest Prime Factor - The system will find the largest prime factor of the input number, for example, an input of '13195' would have an output of '5, 7, 13, 29'.


Multi-threaded Implementation of NetworkAPI: 

The upper bound for the number of threads is set to 10. This ensures efficient parallel execution without overwhelming system resources.
The thread pool is managed using a fixed thread pool from ExecutorService, which means at most 10 requests can be processed concurrently.
