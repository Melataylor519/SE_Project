## 🧪 Performance Optimization: CoordinationComponent & FileDataProcessing

As part of performance tuning efforts, we optimized both the computation coordination logic and the file reading mechanism. Below is a summary of the changes and benchmark results.

---

### 🧠 Optimized Components

#### 1. `CoordinationComponent.java` (`handleComputation()` method)
- **Before:** Used a naive approach to convert loaded data into a string by appending numbers with a comma and trimming the last comma using `substring()`.
- **After:** Used a `StringBuilder` with a `first` flag to build the string more efficiently, reducing overhead from string manipulation.

#### 2. `FileDataProcessing.java` (`read()` method)
- **Before:** Used `Files.readAllLines()` to load the entire file into memory, followed by a stream map to parse integers.
- **After:** Switched to `Files.newBufferedReader()` and processed lines using a streaming pipeline (`reader.lines()`), trimming and filtering while parsing, which improves memory and I/O efficiency.

### 📊 Benchmark Results

We ran 30 iterations comparing the old and new implementations using a synthetic large input file (~100K lines).

| Metric         | Old Version | New Version |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Average Time** | 1078 ms     | 828 ms      |
| **Average Improvement** | —           | **23.19%** |

✅ **Significant improvement observed in most runs**, with some individual improvements exceeding **40%**.
